LiveValidation is a plugin which allows automatic integration of your Rails application with Javascript library [LiveValidation](http://www.livevalidation.com/). This library implements client-side form validation and you can see a demo in its site.

## Important note

This plugin is no longer mantained, and may not work with the newest versions of Rails. I suggest you to use one of the more updated [forks](http://github.com/porras/livevalidation/network).
